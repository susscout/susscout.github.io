          <h2 class="sustainable">What is sustainable fashion?</h2>
            <p>
              Sustainable fashion is clothing that is designed, manufactured, distributed, and used in ways that are 
              environmentally friendly. (https://greendreamer.com/journal/what-is-sustainable-fashion)
            </p>

          <h2 class="fast">What is fast fashion?</h2>
            <p>
              However not all clothing is made sustainably. This is called fast fashion. Fast fashion is a model of 
              making clothing that emphasizes quickly and cheaply available trends. Examples of brands that do this are 
              H&M, Forever 21, Primark, Zara, and Target. (https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/ethical-sustainable-fashion/)

          <h2 class="care">Why should we care?</h2>
            <p>
               Fast fashion is the cause of many human rights violations like excessively low wages and exploitation of 
               children and migrants, low visibility in supply chain, environmental damage like chemical pesticide use, 
               heavy metal contamination, microfiber pollution, and excessive waste of both materials and water. All of 
               this contributes to climate change and human suffering. (https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/ethical-sustainable-fashion/)

          <h2 class="sustain">How do I shop sustainably?</h2>
            <p>
              One of the best ways to shop sustainable fashion is to buy second hand and vintage clothing or swap clothing with friends.
              However when you do need to shop for new clothing there are a few things you can look for to make sure the item was made sustainably. 
              Look for clothing that you can verify is made out of recycled or deadstock fabric. Clothing made in a low to zero waste fashion is also an 
              indicator of sustainability. This includes materials used during the making of the item and packaging used in shipment. Make sure to look 
              as well for clothing made locally or with eco-friendly dyes and certifications. Examples of trustworthy certifications are bluesign and OKEO-TEX. 
              Finally, try to buy clothing made out of natural fibers. This includes linen, cotton, hemp, silk, wool, leather, and cellulose fibers. Once you have 
              your clothes make sure to repair and reuse them for other purposes once they wear out. (https://greendreamer.com/journal/what-is-sustainable-fashion)
